Traffic sign classification using CNN
===

The main goal of this project is to perform Traffic Sign Classification from cropped images of traffic signs such as speed limits, stop signs, and right turn ahead to name a few. This sort of classification is performed very commonly in the autonomous vehicle industry. This project aims to implement a Convolution Neural Network based deep learning algorithms, benchmark their performance, and produce a high performing model.

The project notebook is split into the following hierarchy:

Import and load dataset</br>
Visualization</br>
Preprocessing functions</br>
Data Augmentation</br>
Benchmarking various CNN models</br>
Ensembles</br>
Snapshot Ensemble</br>
Hyperparameter tuning</br>
Final Model

The final model uses MiniVGGNet CNN architecture and gives a Train/Validation/Test set accuracy of 99.90/99.05/99.07 % respectively.
